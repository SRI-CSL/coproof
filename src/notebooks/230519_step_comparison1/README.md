Following the end-step experiments, we now compare pairs of steps to see if we can determine if they can be correctly ordered in terms of step/depth.

Note that this requires proof depth info to distinguish when branches occur.  This is relevant because the main proof is often done first, and then the TCCs and other obligations are done after.
